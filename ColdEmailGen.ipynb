      "I came across the Lead Software Engineer, ITC role at your organization and was impressed by the opportunity to lead a team of engineers in developing innovative solutions for demand and supply planning capabilities. As a final-year Computer Science student at VIT with a strong passion for software development, I am excited to apply for this position and contribute my skills and experience to drive business transformation and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, I am confident in my ability to adapt to new technologies and environments. Although I don't have direct experience with PL/SQL, I am eager to learn and expand my skill set to meet the requirements of the role. My experience with Django, a high-level Python web framework, has taught me the importance of scalable and efficient software design, which I believe would be valuable in developing integrated business planning solutions like O9.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my previous internship at IRCTC, I developed a payroll system that involved designing and implementing algorithms to process complex data sets. This experience has given me a strong understanding of data domains and planning algorithms, which I believe would be relevant to the planning business domain mentioned in the job description. Additionally, my project on Monte Carlo Simulation using manufacturing variables has provided me with a solid understanding of simulation modeling and its applications in planning and optimization.\n",
